   This module implements the WRR algorithm as described below :
          Supposing that there is a server set S = {S0, S1, â€¦, Sn-1};
          W(Si) indicates the weight of Si;
          i indicates the server selected last time, and i is initialized with -1;
          cw is the current weight in scheduling, and cw is initialized with zero;
          max(S) is the maximum weight of all the servers in S;
          gcd(S) is the greatest common divisor of all server weights in S;

          while (true) {
              i = (i + 1) mod n;
              if (i == 0) {
                  cw = cw - gcd(S);
                  if (cw <= 0) {
                      cw = max(S);
                      if (cw == 0)
                      return NULL;
                  }
              }
              if (W(Si) >= cw)
                  return Si;
          }
   This is inspired by the WRR algorithm in the Linux IPVS server but
   generates the sequence beforehand as an optimization
